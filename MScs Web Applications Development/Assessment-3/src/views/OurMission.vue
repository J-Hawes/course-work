  <h1 id="mission">Our Mission</h1>
  <p>
    At the heart of our work is a commitment to ensuring equitable healthcare access for
    underrepresented communities. No one should have to struggle to receive basic medical attention
    simply because of their circumstances. We strive to eliminate the barriers refugees and asylum
    seekers face, offering not only direct medical support but also the education and advocacy
    needed to drive long-term change.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our mission extends beyond individual care—it’s about fostering systemic improvements. We work
    alongside healthcare providers, policymakers, and community leaders to push for better
    healthcare protections for refugees and asylum seekers. By raising awareness and advocating for
    inclusive policies, we aim to ensure these communities receive the recognition and support they
    deserve.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through our outreach programs, medical referrals, and health workshops, we are helping
    individuals not only access treatment but also gain the confidence to advocate for their own
    health needs. Every person deserves compassionate care, and we are dedicated to making that a
    reality.
