  <h2 id="mental">Mental Health Resources</h2>
  <p>
    Mental health is just as important as physical health, yet many refugees and asylum seekers
    struggle with stress, trauma, and emotional distress due to past experiences and the challenges
    of resettlement. Our mental health support services aim to provide compassionate care and
    accessible resources.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Recognizing Mental Health Challenges</strong></p>
  Many individuals may experience symptoms of mental health conditions, including:
  <ul class="my-2">
    <li>
      <strong>Anxiety & Depression</strong> – Feeling overwhelmed, persistent sadness, lack of
      motivation, and difficulty in daily tasks
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</strong> – Flashbacks, nightmares, and emotional
      distress triggered by past traumatic events.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Adjustment Struggles</strong> – Feeling disconnected, isolation from the community,
      difficulty with cultural adaptation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Substance Use & Coping Mechanisms</strong> – The risk of developing unhealthy habits
      to manage emotional pain.
    </li>
