  <h1 id="links">Partner Organisations</h1>
  <p>
    Collaboration is central to our success. We work closely with a diverse range of partner
    organizations, from healthcare providers and advocacy groups to universities and government
    agencies, all of whom share our commitment to improving health outcomes for refugees and asylum
    seekers.
  </p>
  <p>
    These partnerships allow us to expand our reach and ensure comprehensive support for the
    individuals we serve. By joining forces with medical institutions, we provide direct healthcare
    referrals and specialized treatment options. Our relationships with community organizations
    enable us to offer social support services such as housing assistance and employment programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, our collaboration with policymakers allows us to advocate for legislative changes
    that will improve long-term healthcare access. Every partnership strengthens our ability to
    support those in need. Together, we are building a network of care that ensures refugees and
    asylum seekers in Australia receive the medical attention, education, and resources they need to
    live healthier lives.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are grateful for the support of our partners and the impact they have on our mission. If you
    are interested in collaborating with us or learning more about our partner organizations, please
