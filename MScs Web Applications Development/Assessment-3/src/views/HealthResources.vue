        Access to healthcare is a fundamental human right, but many refugees and asylum seekers face
        barriers when seeking medical assistance. Our health resources aim to bridge these gaps by
        providing guidance on accessing medical services, understanding healthcare systems, and
        finding culturally sensitive care options
      </p>
      <p><strong>Finding Healthcare Services</strong></p>
      Refugees and asylum seekers may not always be aware of the healthcare services available to
      them. Here’s how to find the right care:
      <ul class="my-2">

          navigating government-funded medical services.

          access urgent medical assistance, and emergency contacts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Free & Low-Cost Healthcare Providers</strong></p>
      Many organizations and clinics offer free or subsidized medical services for refugees and
      asylum seekers. Some key resources include:
      <ul class="my-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Nonprofit medical organizations</strong> – Groups focused on delivering healthcare
          to refugees, often working with hospitals and clinics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bulk-Billing GPs</strong> – Doctors who offer services with no out-of-pocket fees
          for eligible patients.

        <li>
          <strong>Mental health support groups</strong> – Free counseling, therapy sessions, and
          peer support networks tailored to refugees.

          assistance in community centers or shelters.
        </li>
